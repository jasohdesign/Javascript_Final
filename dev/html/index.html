      <p class="description"> Our digital and physical lives are increasingly becoming converged. Spurred by the wide prevalence of social media and smart devices connecting our lives to the web constantly, the border between what we do online and what we do offline has been blurred to the point of disappearance. Sometimes, we rely more on data of our biological health gathered via smart bands and phones to understand our bodies than to believe in our own feelings and intuitions. Social media such as Facebook, has become such an integral part of our social experiences that we naturally accept "adding someone on Facebook" as an organic step to forming a friendship. What we do on social media affects our physical relationships with people and vice versa. 

      <br><br>
      As our presence in the digital world become more and more prominent, how do our ethical, social, and philosophical values transfer digitally? What are the rules and social habits that are formed online differently from offline? When our possessions in the digital realm live beyond our physical lives, how does that change our behavior towards life and death?

      <h1>US IN THE DIGITAL WORLD</h1>
      <hr>
      <p class="description">As more of our lives become digitalized, our physical bodies become less central to our identity. In the digital world, people are not marked by bodily presence but identified as patterns. People become data objects.

      In a pool of data, we are identified and deidentified by machines. Our data are computed and packaged for different advertisement companies in return for personalized ads. During this process, our organic experiences are simply punched into algorithms and passed into sterile categories that obliterate real life nuances.

      <h1>WHAT ABOUT WHEN WE DIE?</h1>
      <hr>
      
      <p class="description"> 
      When we die in the physical world, we bury and cremate the corpse as a sign of sanctifying the life of the deceased. In many cultures, the destruction of the body signifies the termination of oneâ€™s existence in the physical world and the transferal to the spiritual world. There are not only rituals to officiate death but also spaces designated for the dead. Cemeteries have a distinct land use specific to bury the corpse of deceased. 

      These concerns led me to my first project: Facebook Online Obituary Generator. As more people on Facebook die every year, there is a pressing need to figure out how to deal with death online. Studies show that 8,000 users on Facebook die every day. With that rate, by 2065, deceased users will outnumber the living users. In the future, will Facebook turn into a digital graveyard?
